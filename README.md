# sfpc-marquee
A widget you can include to link out to everyone's wonderful blogs :sparkle: 


### General idea
We could all include a publicly hosted js file that injects an html snippet into your site. That way someone only needs to add a link to their blog in one place (here!)

### Todos
- [ ] Create version 1 of a widget (initial idea is a scrolling marquee) 
- [ ] Create js file to inject html 
- [ ] Deploy the server (free heroku?)
